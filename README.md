# Hotel Bookings Capstone Project

This repository contains capstone project on the **Hotel Bookings dataset**.  
The project was done as part of the GTC Machine Learning course.  

## Repository Contents
- **hotel_bookings_capstone.ipynb** → The Google Colab notebook with data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis.  
- **hotel_bookings.csv** → The dataset used in this project.  
- **README.md** → This file, describing the project.  

## Project Steps
1. Uploaded the dataset to Google Colab.  
2. Loaded the data into a Pandas DataFrame.  
3. Explored the dataset (shape, columns, missing values, statistics).  
4. Cleaned missing values and fixed data types.  
5. Did some basic visualizations (cancellations, hotel type distribution, ADR by hotel).  
6. Preprocessed the data:
   - Encoded categorical variables  
   - Scaled numerical features  
7. Summarized the findings.  

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open the notebook `hotel_bookings_capstone.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.  
3. Run the cells step by step.
